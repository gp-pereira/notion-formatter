# Notion Formatter

[![CI/CD](https://github.com/gp-pereira/notion-formatter/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gp-pereira/notion-formatter/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml)

## Motivation
While I'm reading, I like to copy interesting excerpts into Notion so I can review them later.

The problem is that when I copy a paragraph, I also copy the its formatting. 

In the past, I'd have to paste it and fix this line by line.

But not anymore. This code periodically checks for updated pages and formats them.
