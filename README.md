## Motivation
While I'm reading, I like to copy interesting excerpts into Notion so I can review them later.

The problem is that when I copy a paragraph, I also copy its formatting. 

In the past, I'd have to paste it and fix this line by line.

But not anymore. This code periodically checks for updated pages and formats them.

## Results

In case you're wondering, the excerpt above comes from Dave Farley's book, Modern Software Engineering.

You can find many more of them (now **properly formatted**) in my [Notion Book Notes](https://www.notion.so/7d19da5c61194297a0cba6f935511ba1?v=9c75395dff014f439be5162d7d252746).
